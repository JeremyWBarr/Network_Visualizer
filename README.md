# Network Visualizer
## Jeremy Barr


Allows user to upload an excel .XLS file containing nodes and edges of a given network.

Network Visualizer will take this input and construct a graph that displays the connections between all of the nodes in the network.

This tool will also let the user customize and export the graph to their own personal needs and desires.
